Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Love your vision and think it'll happen, all the pieces are there.Gm Tony 🫂💜 Hope you have a great one today! Gm Pextar ☕ have a good one!when ur timeline is all uncles 😹

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksFound the Safari issue and sent a patch to ndk to fix it, hopefully it will be merged soon.Is a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one? Let me know!"Los que me han hecho daño, los políticos que me han hecho daño, ellos serán sustituidos, yo no tengo sustituta, me moriré siendo Lola Flores"

Bonjour Mara, happy Friday! 🫂💜🤙We've made payments as frictionless as liking a post and we still excited about it 😹Looks amazing!🔥Buenos días Nostr! Empezando el día por rumbas 👏 +1000You can try  or use snort.social and upload from therePersian  and Ukrainian  added, thanks to  and boost for visibility 👇

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

thoughts?
interests?I'm blown away by the fast translations. We got 5 languages in a day 🤯 building for the world 🗺️🇷🇺 Хабла говорит по-русски 

Спасибо  💜gotta admit I had a crush on Meryl 🔥

Done 🫡Omw!What languages do you speak? Can add more to the project. I'm paying 10k sats to Habla translators for completing a language.

YesGot big news, will share soon 🥹You can change emoji name anytime. You could import and edit emoji from other lists.🇩🇪 Habla spricht Deutsch 

Danke  💜 I used 30001, not sure if it supports adding and removing emoji, does it  ?Awesome 😍 cc Hungry for memes? Add wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme to your relays list and have all the best memes on  aggregated for you and available at your fingertips in your global feed. 

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.
 being translated to German already 💜 open source is awesome🇪🇸 Habla habla Español 

🇯🇵  Hablaは日本語を話します ありがとうございます! is deployed now in case you want to check, will try to add context to strings in Crowdin.Help the project and get some sats ⚡

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

Pablo can share more info but iirc Zapstr used kind 31337 for audio and podcast tracks. Looking forward to try podstr, love the idea!Got a custom URL on Habla thank you  🔥🔥🔥

These two nips is all we need to have transparent Inter-kind Inter operation and compete with super apps’ UX without the centralizationHay relays con políticas relacionadas con el pow pero no veo que se utilice mucho fuera de eso.who prefers likes to sats? sats are internet points you can use to pay for stuffAgree, fiatjaf and others are writing a NIP for fallbacks. There is also some discussion around user defined kind handlers, clients could use this to open an unsupported event kind in a user defined app.I'm working on making it easier so sorry for the non obvious UX. For logging in right now you need to use Alby extension on desktop or nostore on mobile to store your nostr key. Once you have that, click Login and select "Nostr extension" and you should be able to write, repost and so on.

This will get easier in the future and more options will be available.No problem, check out  for the specPoW-21 is shown under username. iiuc this means that note id has 21 leading bits set to 0.Issuer is what makes a badge valuable 💯 we've seen a few examples of the things you mentioned:

Nostr-ify all the things! 


Thanks for the recommendations! Vagabond is 👌🫂☕have a good one!The coolest thing about writing long form content over nostr is the ability to combine all kinds of nostr events in a post. NIP 27 mentions enable this, I wonder why other nostr blogging sites are not implementing it. Composability is one of the killer features imo.More clients should allow you to filter feeds by your people lists. Clip from 

iirc there was a Chess NIP that could be used to implement Go or other games over nostr. Hope someone builds it.Gotta check out these! Weird and creepy afThis is one of my favorites. I got into Go after watching but haven't played in ages, amazing game!おはようNさん💜Gm sir, have a good one ☕💜🤗GM nostr, what's your favorite ? Pic related, Gatsu from Berserk.

Yes, thought about this too, should be doable.You can highlight a portion of an article in Habla by selecting the text and clicking the highlighter button that appears on the bottom right of screen.


On highlighter go to Search tab and enter s URL, after the content is loaded the UX is similar to Habla. select text, preview, highlight. Hope it helps.Thanks for your feedback man, join us anytime!Awesome, can't wait to test it 🤗💯Y'all sleeping on highlights, check out highlighter.com and  habla.news Clients such as Amethyst show highlights on your feed and are a great way to discover content on nostr and the web.

Nearly ready...  is now rendering images, hashtags, links, and user mentions in notes.

Looks 🔥 

Everything can be listed, even lists 😜Nice working space! loving the feed for lists of people, "Follow all" is nice to have. Also support for the emoji tag would be cool 🤗Well deserved man, your content is top notch ⚡🪄 Your wish is my command

These two nips is all we need to have transparent Inter-kind Inter operation and compete with super apps’ UX without the centralizationHay relays con políticas relacionadas con el pow pero no veo que se utilice mucho fuera de eso.who prefers likes to sats? sats are internet points you can use to pay for stuffAgree, fiatjaf and others are writing a NIP for fallbacks. There is also some discussion around user defined kind handlers, clients could use this to open an unsupported event kind in a user defined app.I'm working on making it easier so sorry for the non obvious UX. For logging in right now you need to use Alby extension on desktop or nostore on mobile to store your nostr key. Once you have that, click Login and select "Nostr extension" and you should be able to write, repost and so on.

This will get easier in the future and more options will be available.No problem, check out  for the specPoW-21 is shown under username. iiuc this means that note id has 21 leading bits set to 0.Issuer is what makes a badge valuable 💯 we've seen a few examples of the things you mentioned:

Thanks for the recommendations! Vagabond is 👌🫂☕have a good one!The coolest thing about writing long form content over nostr is the ability to combine all kinds of nostr events in a post. NIP 27 mentions enable this, I wonder why other nostr blogging sites are not implementing it. Composability is one of the killer features imo.More clients should allow you to filter feeds by your people lists. Clip from

Yes, thought about this too, should be doable.You can highlight a portion of an article in Habla by selecting the text and clicking the highlighter button that appears on the bottom right of screen.


On highlighter go to Search tab and enter s URL, after the content is loaded the UX is similar to Habla. select text, preview, highlight. Hope it helps.Thanks for your feedback man, join us anytime!Y'all sleeping on highlights, check out highlighter.com and  habla.news Clients such as Amethyst show highlights on your feed and are a great way to discover content on nostr and the web.

Nearly ready...  is now rendering images, hashtags, links, and user mentions in notes.

Looks 🔥 

Everything can be listed, even lists 😜Nice working space! loving the feed for lists of people, "Follow all" is nice to have. Also support for the emoji tag would be cool 🤗There is a lot of interest in "following lists" too, wdyt?you got me 😜When you start the day sending patches to multiple nostr open source projects

Regarding dark mode it now should respect your system settings. If you switch modes in your OS will be reflected on the app.Amazing feedback Moon 💜 For 1 and 2 I plan to bring them back but i want everything to look good so will do when is designed.

👏 Well deserved!

Thanks for the big zap 💜🫂 Will try to get this out asap ⚡ is publishing some 🔥 content on YouTube about Nostr this is already implemented in the upcoming Habla release and you got the moon URL 😉   Just need a bit more time to release it and make it generally available.Exactly, wouldn't get very close if they have offspring, they are very protective! 💜🐮GM Tanel, have a good one 🫂Replied from amethyst, looks like it shows nip 94 as regular poasts.GM Fishcake 🐮🫂💜🇯🇵Sure! It's the Urbasa Natural Park located in Navarra (Spain) in Europe. Their site is  A magical place.Yes, they belong to farmers in the area but is a natural park where animals are allowed to roam free. You can see donkeys, horses and cows everywhere. They are used to people so are pretty chill. There are also wild boars though, luckily didn't run into one 😅GM nostr, found a group of cows yesterday while walking in the forest. They are chill af, resting and ruminating in the shades, protected from the heat and sun. Happy Monday! 🐮

GM nostr! Not shippostig that much lately since I gotta balance family, work, nostr and other stuff. Cherish and spend time with your loved ones, they are more important than everything else 💜🫂Another thing to consider is that the highlight author could set the OP author pubkey as the zap target so zaps to the highlight will go to the OP. I'll probably do this for my highlights when author is on nostr.I think I'll make it opt in, perhaps with an slider that lets you choose how much each person gets 🤔This is bad, next update will show open in wallet button that should let you choose a Lightning wallet. Will also make QR clickable with same behaviour.1 is doable but hadnt considered it, should be easy to do. 2 is planned, for things like highlights I'll give you the option to zap curator and author.

Also want to be able to fork articles and create derived versions that are linked to the original (translated articles), which will forward zaps to the origina authorl or let you choose an split.Habla is going in this direction, already started working on it.I love it, is the UX I envision for habla. Clean, readable UI and contextualized conversations on highlights. Read, write, bookmark, highlight, subscribe. Awesome work 👏eyes

これを着ていくか   is good for visibility, hope you find someone!Paging Bullish on nostr markets

That it'll get cooler with time, more social (and not social) experiences will be possible on nostr.
NIP94 File header in Amethyst media tab and is only the beginning, lots of "other stuff" will be on nostr in due time. All zapable, addressable and composable. All is an event, they just have different kinds. Can you imagine the possibilities?
Love Haskell since it makes it easy to work with these abstractions although I'm in JS purgatory 😋 I think REQ filters in nostr might be a semigroup, you can add them with an associative operation, ndk library uses this to batch multiple REQ filters into one. There could be a nostr monad, REQ is applicative (adding filters) and monadic (sequence REQ requests after eose).Such a meeting will be held one day before the conference itself.

Bohemian Nostrich meetup 7.6. 2023they are everywhere! Perhaps some concrete examples help build intuition: every time you reduce a collection you are probably using a Monoid The content is a product of who the audience on the platform is. Content fits the market not the other way around.

What we are missing just now is fullscreen video, screen sharing, speaker/mic sharing, automated content generation, integrated money and the gamification of all these things.

Maybe we are just super early and all this things will be bootstrapped out of current things?

But nostr is mostly being used to build Twitter clones, and whilst this has some value none of Twitters replicas will eat it. It’s a sideways move for 90% of users, one chat UX to another chat UX.

The biggest problem for Twitter type platform is that nobody buys stuff there, so it just has a lot less commerce and a much smaller economy.

People buy stuff in an audiovideo UX, people buy stuff in shared spaces, people buy stuff when it’s easy.

The next big social platform might be built on nostr, or it might not, but it will probably be based on fullscreen video. You don’t see 13 year olds swiping text, it feels like school to them.

They crowd to loud bright things that move fast, there’s a big non-verbal bit rate in UX that we are missing.

If nostr or a monolithic nostr client can hook the generation after TikTok then you will have  adoption by default. No way it happens with horizontal migration any time soon, likely to only see it in our lifetimes if it surfs demographics.

There’s now a way to do that. 
There wasn’t before.  Is very early, don't think any client has this featureAmethyst shows highlights and has a media feed 🤩 It also handles naddr mentions perfectly, this is my favorite client atm.

Would you pay a small subscription fee for getting a vanity URL, NIP05 and SEO friendly pages in Habla?  All your content would be accesible from nostr but also indexed by search engines and have nice URLs and previews when sharing for  profile and  postYesNoWrote about this today, there are a few NIP 50 compatible relays already 🤗 would also allow to pay people that are contributing, I'm getting lots of help.Might apply with habla.news We have a clear roadmap for the project and a lot of improvements in the works and coming soon. Can get it done a lot faster with funding 🤔

I'd love to it time permits. It'll be in Habla for sure, both searching in one relay or on all your search compatible relays. Currently is hardcoded but I'm making some changes.

Trying to make a point here, devs do something! 😜Yes although I found it buggy at times and doesn't support mentioning relays. But you can read, comment, boost and zap long form articles from Amethysts, pretty cool!Relays can censor you but you can always rebroadcast your poasts to other relays.Looks great with the preview on Amethyst.

Yeah, some clients don't support these mentions yet unfortunately. Using them to raise awareness. In the meantime you can use  or habla.newsWrote a brief article about Search (NIP 50) compatible relays, check it out!

Experimenting with using labels to show relay capabilities. Blog, Markets, Chat, Auth, Search are more human friendly representations of NIPs that the relay supports. Sorry for the random colors, work in progress lol

Need to add it here too. Wip.You first, work nextGrateful for the work Nostr promoters and educators like  and  are doing. Apps are cool but for nostr to succeed we need to make it accesible, improve the UX a lot and most importantly: spread the word 🗣️Yes, habla uses kind 30023 (post) and 30024 (draft) for articles, so events that reuse that kind (bounties for instance) will show up in habla. I think we might want specific kinds for other types of content like podcast, there are several audio apps over nostr like Zapstr.live that could be useful here. Hope it helps!🧪 NIP 30 by Alex Gleason  will allow you to use custom emoji for kind 0 (profile) and kind 1 (note) events 🐸How do you sign-in to a Nostr website?

Nostr websites can be confusing if you haven’t used a signing extension like Alby before so I made a little demo video to try to clarify how this works. In it I featured Alby, Highlighter, Primal, Wavman, and Habla.

Jackedclients need to agree on a standard replaceable event for last seen notification time imo, this is annoying afThe pleb waiting for you to to say GN back:

 's idea of using private zaps for hiding DM metadata could be generalized as using third-party trusted services to send encrypted DM blobs on your behalf.

These third-parties would be the ones interacting with the relays, not you. If the DMs leaked the public would see just that one of these servers sent a DM to someone, but they wouldn't know who was the original sender.

The receiver would get these messages and decrypt them to be able to see the actual message signed by you inside.

Relays could ban these services if they were being abusive, or charge these services directly (and then they would charge you).

Receivers could also refuse to decrypt and just discard messages from services known for being spammy.Acta, non verbaUna vez publicado el contenido a nostr como nip23 se puede utilizar nblog  de  para generar una web con los artículos de una pubkey prerenderizados.Y si hacemos un repost del contenido del blog a nostr?

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Love your vision and think it'll happen, all the pieces are there.Gm Tony 🫂💜 Hope you have a great one today! Gm Pextar ☕ have a good one!when ur timeline is all uncles 😹

Gm Marie, for me the one and only uncle is  😜Nosdias Quentin, hablamos pronto!Good morning 🌄🤗おはようございますゆたろさん🤗Good morning nostr, lots to do today but I'm a slow starter ☕🥐

OG snort ⚡🔥


おはよう、fiatjafさんmattnさんのプロフィール写真は面白いです rabbit uses a locally stored relay list if I'm not mistaken. was working on something like this. With nostr profile metadata and  you could create a microsite à la linktree 🤔there is an app by the NIP author, check out  where Pablo demoes it. there is also a huge bounty to add it to Damus  but no takers yet. I'd love NIP-46 in Amethyst too.think i found my zap signature

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksFound the Safari issue and sent a patch to ndk to fix it, hopefully it will be merged soon.Is a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre
Que canta y llora tras pasados siglos de horror
Siento a Dios que perfuma mi alma
Y en el mundo voy sembrando rosas, en vez de dolor

Thanks man, hope this week is more relaxed for you too 🫂Very long and hard last few weeks 😞 going to take it easy today 🤙へとへとYeah need to add back some features. You can go to habla.news/relays and pick one but gotta polish these screens, don't like how it looks currently.Thx Karnage, all my gear is open source.Same but with Street Fighter 6 😹 Next nostrpreneur: "Monetizing your gaming addiction"España



Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.


You mean nostr web apps?Safari is the new IEgrazzie! This is live now.Buongiorno Nostr! Habla parla italiano! 🇮🇹 🫡🤗 send notes with custom emoji autocompletion added to 

Emojis are fun  I am in the process of building lists. Here you'll find some people to zap ...

 is the cutest nostr clientIs a bug affecting Safari and iOS browser, those are behind in web standards support. I will fix it, in the meantime try another browser and should work.Missing feature, will add! implemented your custom emoji list proposal, still need to make them editable and ability to add lists but I've created some we can use for testing already.Of course!🤗 Imma fix this soon, sorry for the inconvenience Sure, feel free to add more:     Gm nostr, zap some artists today!  cc Kind 30030: categorized custom emoji lists. Proposal by   author of nostter kind 30030 I use words as d tags (these are a timestamp by default). The URL for a post is your nip05 username and d tag, so if you use words for the d identifier you'll get a URL like that for the article.I've sent a PR :)
Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

Rabbitだとカスタム絵文字設定でこう  
 
No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one? Let me know!"Los que me han hecho daño, los políticos que me han hecho daño, ellos serán sustituidos, yo no tengo sustituta, me moriré siendo Lola Flores"

Bonjour Mara, happy Friday! 🫂💜🤙We've made payments as frictionless as liking a post and we still excited about it 😹Looks amazing!🔥Buenos días Nostr! Empezando el día por rumbas 👏 +1000You can try  or use snort.social and upload from therePersian  and Ukrainian  added, thanks to  and boost for visibility 👇

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

thoughts?
interests?I'm blown away by the fast translations. We got 5 languages in a day 🤯 building for the world 🗺️🇷🇺 Хабла говорит по-русски 

Спасибо  💜gotta admit I had a crush on Meryl 🔥

Done 🫡Omw!What languages do you speak? Can add more to the project. I'm paying 10k sats to Habla translators for completing a language.

YesGot big news, will share soon 🥹You can change emoji name anytime. You could import and edit emoji from other lists.🇩🇪 Habla spricht Deutsch 

Danke  💜 I used 30001, not sure if it supports adding and removing emoji, does it  ?Awesome 😍 cc Hungry for memes? Add wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme to your relays list and have all the best memes on  aggregated for you and available at your fingertips in your global feed. 

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.
 being translated to German already 💜 open source is awesome🇪🇸 Habla habla Español

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

Pablo can share more info but iirc Zapstr used kind 31337 for audio and podcast tracks. Looking forward to try podstr, love the idea!Got a custom URL on Habla thank you  🔥🔥🔥

There is also some discussion around user defined kind handlers, clients could use this to open an unsupported event kind in a user defined app.I'm working on making it easier so sorry for the non obvious UX. For logging in right now you need to use Alby extension on desktop or nostore on mobile to store your nostr key.

Thanks for the recommendations! Vagabond is 👌🫂☕have a good one!The coolest thing about writing long form content over nostr is the ability to combine all kinds of nostr events in a post. NIP 27 mentions enable this, I wonder why other nostr blogging sites are not implementing it. Composability is one of the killer features imo.More clients should allow you to filter feeds by your people lists. Clip from 

iirc there was a Chess NIP that could be used to implement Go or other games over nostr. Hope someone builds it.Gotta check out these! Weird and creepy afThis is one of my favorites.

Yes, thought about this too, should be doable.You can highlight a portion of an article in Habla by selecting the text and clicking the highlighter button that appears on the bottom right of screen.


On highlighter go to Search tab and enter s URL, after the content is loaded the UX is similar to Habla. select text, preview, highlight. Hope it helps.Thanks for your feedback man, join us anytime!Awesome, can't wait to test it 🤗💯Y'all sleeping on highlights, check out highlighter.com and  habla.news Clients such as Amethyst show highlights on your feed and are a great way to discover content on nostr and the web.

Looks 🔥 

Everything can be listed, even lists 😜Nice working space! loving the feed for lists of people, "Follow all" is nice to have. Also support for the emoji tag would be cool 🤗There is a lot of interest in "following lists" too, wdyt?you got me 😜When you start the day sending patches to multiple nostr open source projects

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Love your vision and think it'll happen, all the pieces are there.Gm Tony 🫂💜 Hope you have a great one today! Gm Pextar ☕ have a good one!when ur timeline is all uncles 😹

おはよう、fiatjafさんmattnさんのプロフィール写真は面白いです rabbit uses a locally stored relay list if I'm not mistaken. was working on something like this. With nostr profile metadata and  you could create a microsite à la linktree 🤔there is an app by the NIP author, check out  where Pablo demoes it. there is also a huge bounty to add it to Damus  but no takers yet. I'd love NIP-46 in Amethyst too.think i found my zap signature

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksFound the Safari issue and sent a patch to ndk to fix it, hopefully it will be merged soon.Is a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one?

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.

🇯🇵  Hablaは日本語を話します ありがとうございます! is deployed now in case you want to check, will try to add context to strings in Crowdin.Help the project and get some sats ⚡

 💦There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

👏 Well deserved!

Thanks for the big zap 💜🫂 Will try to get this out asap ⚡ is publishing some 🔥 content on YouTube about Nostr this is already implemented in the upcoming Habla release and you got the moon URL 😉   Just need a bit more time to release it and make it generally available.Exactly, wouldn't get very close if they have offspring, they are very protective! 💜🐮GM Tanel, have a good one 🫂Replied from amethyst, looks like it shows nip 94 as regular poasts.GM Fishcake 🐮🫂💜🇯🇵Sure! It's the Urbasa Natural Park located in Navarra (Spain) in Europe. Their site is  A magical place.Yes, they belong to farmers in the area but is a natural park where animals are allowed to roam free. You can see donkeys, horses and cows everywhere. They are used to people so are pretty chill. There are also wild boars though, luckily didn't run into one 😅GM nostr, found a group of cows yesterday while walking in the forest. They are chill af, resting and ruminating in the shades, protected from the heat and sun. Happy Monday! 🐮

I think I'll make it opt in, perhaps with an slider that lets you choose how much each person gets 🤔This is bad, next update will show open in wallet button that should let you choose a Lightning wallet. Will also make QR clickable with same behaviour.1 is doable but hadnt considered it, should be easy to do. 2 is planned, for things like highlights I'll give you the option to zap curator and author.

Also want to be able to fork articles and create derived versions that are linked to the original (translated articles), which will forward zaps to the origina authorl or let you choose an split.Habla is going in this direction, already started working on it.I love it, is the UX I envision for habla. Clean, readable UI and contextualized conversations on highlights. Read, write, bookmark, highlight, subscribe. Awesome work 👏eyes

NIP94 File header in Amethyst media tab and is only the beginning, lots of "other stuff" will be on nostr in due time. All zapable, addressable and composable. All is an event, they just have different kinds. Can you imagine the possibilities?
Love Haskell since it makes it easy to work with these abstractions although I'm in JS purgatory 😋 I think REQ filters in nostr might be a semigroup, you can add them with an associative operation, ndk library uses this to batch multiple REQ filters into one. There could be a nostr monad, REQ is applicative (adding filters) and monadic (sequence REQ requests after eose).🤗 would also allow to pay people that are contributing, I'm getting lots of help.Might apply with habla.news We have a clear roadmap for the project and a lot of improvements in the works and coming soon.

But you can read, comment, boost and zap long form articles from Amethysts, pretty cool!Relays can censor you but you can always rebroadcast your poasts to other relays.Looks great with the preview on Amethyst.

Experimenting with using labels to show relay capabilities. Blog, Markets, Chat, Auth, Search are more human friendly representations of NIPs that the relay supports. Sorry for the random colors, work in progress lol

🦓Will there be a nostr meetup for the conference? That would be cool👀 interested in this, let me know if I can help!soon™️ we are working on a FAQ that should cover most of the questions people have, also reworking and simplifying the site a bit.Btw check out  it allows to pase an naddr and add/remove relays.reliable is the d tag, been using human readable strings. How this will work is that I'll offer NIP05 addresses in Habla, then your username is an alias for an nprofile. Can use the d tag as unique identifier for posts under your username. Will also make it compatible with external nostr address, this already works  is just not prerendered.How do these URLs look? 🤔 mfw looking at my gas bill

🫂💜 same, let's keep building 👷‍♂️I know, plan is to require a password and use it to encrypt stored private key. Habla will ask for password when it needs to sign to decrypt key and won't keep it in memory. Also give them a NIP05 they can use as username and their profile under habla.news/username. All this while trying to educate them regarding key management.🫂 indeed, i struggle with this too. hard not to be absorbed by it.Yes, we need to do it. I'm going to try to do my part with content in Spanish, I'm shilling nostr to my irl friends too and getting their feedback. Trying to make Habla super newbie friendly and add nostr onboarding. Lots to build/write/record.Can't wait for  to launch outer space 👽You first, work nextGrateful for the work Nostr promoters and educators like  and  are doing. Apps are cool but for nostr to succeed we need to make it accesible, improve the UX a lot and most importantly: spread the word 🗣️Yes, habla uses kind 30023 (post) and 30024 (draft) for articles, so events that reuse that kind (bounties for instance) will show up in habla. I think we might want specific kinds for other types of content like podcast, there are several audio apps over nostr like Zapstr.live that could be useful here. Hope it helps!🧪 NIP 30 by Alex Gleason  will allow you to use custom emoji for kind 0 (profile) and kind 1 (note) events 🐸How do you sign-in to a Nostr website?

Jackedclients need to agree on a standard replaceable event for last seen notification time imo, this is annoying afThe pleb waiting for you to to say GN back:

 's idea of using private zaps for hiding DM metadata could be generalized as using third-party trusted services to send encrypted DM blobs on your behalf.

These third-parties would be the ones interacting with the relays, not you. If the DMs leaked the public would see just that one of these servers sent a DM to someone, but they wouldn't know who was the original sender.

The receiver would get these messages and decrypt them to be able to see the actual message signed by you inside.

Relays could ban these services if they were being abusive, or charge these services directly (and then they would charge you).

Receivers could also refuse to decrypt and just discard messages from services known for being spammy.Acta, non verbaUna vez publicado el contenido a nostr como nip23 se puede utilizar nblog  de  para generar una web con los artículos de una pubkey prerenderizados.Y si hacemos un repost del contenido del blog a nostr?

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one?

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.

There is also some discussion around user defined kind handlers, clients could use this to open an unsupported event kind in a user defined app.I'm working on making it easier so sorry for the non obvious UX. For logging in right now you need to use Alby extension on desktop or nostore on mobile to store your nostr key. Once you have that, click Login and select "Nostr extension" and you should be able to write, repost and so on.

This will get easier in the future and more options will be available.No problem, check out  for the specPoW-21 is shown under username. iiuc this means that note id has 21 leading bits set to 0.Issuer is what makes a badge valuable 💯 we've seen a few examples of the things you mentioned:

Thanks for the recommendations! Vagabond is 👌🫂☕have a good one!The coolest thing about writing long form content over nostr is the ability to combine all kinds of nostr events in a post. NIP 27 mentions enable this, I wonder why other nostr blogging sites are not implementing it. Composability is one of the killer features imo.More clients should allow you to filter feeds by your people lists. Clip from

Hope it helps.Thanks for your feedback man, join us anytime!Awesome, can't wait to test it 🤗💯Y'all sleeping on highlights, check out highlighter.com and  habla.news Clients such as Amethyst show highlights on your feed and are a great way to discover content on nostr and the web.

NIP-31 or 32 (iirc) alt tags. Human-readable context for any event kind.

NIP-89: unknown-kind app handlers+recommendations.

These two nips is all we need to have transparent Inter-kind Inter operation and compete with super apps’ UX without the centralizationHay relays con políticas relacionadas con el pow pero no veo que se utilice mucho fuera de eso.who prefers likes to sats? sats are internet points you can use to pay for stuffAgree, fiatjaf and others are writing a NIP for fallbacks. There is also some discussion around user defined kind handlers, clients could use this to open an unsupported event kind in a user defined app.I'm working on making it easier so sorry for the non obvious UX. For logging in right now you need to use Alby extension on desktop or nostore on mobile to store your nostr key. Once you have that, click Login and select "Nostr extension" and you should be able to write, repost and so on.

This will get easier in the future and more options will be available.No problem, check out  for the specPoW-21 is shown under username. iiuc this means that note id has 21 leading bits set to 0.Issuer is what makes a badge valuable 💯 we've seen a few examples of the things you mentioned:

🫂GM Cosmic, gonna be a good one today 💜The switch at the top center, tap it and will allow to switch lists. I recommend you create a list of people in listr.lol by  it'll show up in Amethyst right away. shows Proof of Work on notes

dat pow 😏I just added  cool Nostr zap widget to  and replaced the direct lightning donation button.

Nostr-ify all the things! 


Thanks for the recommendations! Vagabond is 👌🫂☕have a good one!The coolest thing about writing long form content over nostr is the ability to combine all kinds of nostr events in a post. NIP 27 mentions enable this, I wonder why other nostr blogging sites are not implementing it. Composability is one of the killer features imo.More clients should allow you to filter feeds by your people lists. Clip from 

iirc there was a Chess NIP that could be used to implement Go or other games over nostr. Hope someone builds it.Gotta check out these! Weird and creepy afThis is one of my favorites. I got into Go after watching but haven't played in ages, amazing game!おはようNさん💜Gm sir, have a good one ☕💜🤗GM nostr, what's your favorite ? Pic related, Gatsu from Berserk.

Yes, thought about this too, should be doable.You can highlight a portion of an article in Habla by selecting the text and clicking the highlighter button that appears on the bottom right of screen.


On highlighter go to Search tab and enter s URL, after the content is loaded the UX is similar to Habla. select text, preview, highlight. Hope it helps.Thanks for your feedback man, join us anytime!Awesome, can't wait to test it 🤗💯Y'all sleeping on highlights, check out highlighter.com and  habla.news Clients such as Amethyst show highlights on your feed and are a great way to discover content on nostr and the web.

Nearly ready...  is now rendering images, hashtags, links, and user mentions in notes.

Looks 🔥 

Everything can be listed, even lists 😜Nice working space! loving the feed for lists of people, "Follow all" is nice to have. Also support for the emoji tag would be cool 🤗There is a lot of interest in "following lists" too, wdyt?you got me 😜When you start the day sending patches to multiple nostr open source projects

Regarding dark mode it now should respect your system settings. If you switch modes in your OS will be reflected on the app.Amazing feedback Moon 💜 For 1 and 2 I plan to bring them back but i want everything to look good so will do when is designed. For 3 thanks for the detailed report, looks like a bug i need to fix, will get back to you soon!Genial, es donde escucho los pods.

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Love your vision and think it'll happen, all the pieces are there.Gm Tony 🫂💜 Hope you have a great one today! Gm Pextar ☕ have a good one!when ur timeline is all uncles 😹

Gm Marie, for me the one and only uncle is  😜Nosdias Quentin, hablamos pronto!Good morning 🌄🤗おはようございますゆたろさん🤗Good morning nostr, lots to do today but I'm a slow starter ☕🥐

OG snort ⚡🔥


おはよう、fiatjafさんmattnさんのプロフィール写真は面白いです rabbit uses a locally stored relay list if I'm not mistaken. was working on something like this. With nostr profile metadata and  you could create a microsite à la linktree 🤔there is an app by the NIP author, check out  where Pablo demoes it. there is also a huge bounty to add it to Damus  but no takers yet. I'd love NIP-46 in Amethyst too.think i found my zap signature

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksFound the Safari issue and sent a patch to ndk to fix it, hopefully it will be merged soon.Is a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre
Que canta y llora tras pasados siglos de horror

Y en el mundo voy sembrando rosas, en vez de dolor

Thanks man, hope this week is more relaxed for you too 🫂Very long and hard last few weeks 😞 going to take it easy today 🤙へとへとYeah need to add back some features. You can go to habla.news/relays and pick one but gotta polish these screens, don't like how it looks currently.Thx Karnage, all my gear is open source.Same but with Street Fighter 6 😹 Next nostrpreneur: "Monetizing your gaming addiction"España



Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.


You mean nostr web apps?Safari is the new IEgrazzie! This is live now.Buongiorno Nostr! Habla parla italiano! 🇮🇹 🫡🤗 send notes with custom emoji autocompletion added to 

Emojis are fun  I am in the process of building lists. Here you'll find some people to zap ...

 is the cutest nostr clientIs a bug affecting Safari and iOS browser, those are behind in web standards support. I will fix it, in the meantime try another browser and should work.Missing feature, will add! implemented your custom emoji list proposal, still need to make them editable and ability to add lists but I've created some we can use for testing already.Of course!🤗 Imma fix this soon, sorry for the inconvenience Sure, feel free to add more:     Gm nostr, zap some artists today!  cc Kind 30030: categorized custom emoji lists. Proposal by   author of nostter kind 30030 I use words as d tags (these are a timestamp by default). The URL for a post is your nip05 username and d tag, so if you use words for the d identifier you'll get a URL like that for the article.I've sent a PR :)
Zapvertising in action cc Enorme Lola. Aquí con otra mujer que también admiro mucho

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one? Let me know!"Los que me han hecho daño, los políticos que me han hecho daño, ellos serán sustituidos, yo no tengo sustituta, me moriré siendo Lola Flores"

Bonjour Mara, happy Friday! 🫂💜🤙We've made payments as frictionless as liking a post and we still excited about it 😹Looks amazing!🔥Buenos días Nostr! Empezando el día por rumbas 👏 +1000You can try  or use snort.social and upload from therePersian  and Ukrainian  added, thanks to  and boost for visibility 👇

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

thoughts?
interests?I'm blown away by the fast translations. We got 5 languages in a day 🤯 building for the world 🗺️🇷🇺 Хабла говорит по-русски 

Спасибо  💜gotta admit I had a crush on Meryl 🔥

Done 🫡Omw!What languages do you speak? Can add more to the project. I'm paying 10k sats to Habla translators for completing a language.

YesGot big news, will share soon 🥹You can change emoji name anytime. You could import and edit emoji from other lists.🇩🇪 Habla spricht Deutsch 

Danke  💜 I used 30001, not sure if it supports adding and removing emoji, does it  ?Awesome 😍 cc Hungry for memes? Add wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme to your relays list and have all the best memes on  aggregated for you and available at your fingertips in your global feed. 

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.
 being translated to German already 💜 open source is awesome🇪🇸 Habla habla Español 

🇯🇵  Hablaは日本語を話します ありがとうございます! is deployed now in case you want to check, will try to add context to strings in Crowdin.Help the project and get some sats ⚡

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

Pablo can share more info but iirc Zapstr used kind 31337 for audio and podcast tracks. Looking forward to try podstr, love the idea!Got a custom URL on Habla thank you  🔥🔥🔥

👏 Well deserved!

Thanks for the big zap 💜🫂 Will try to get this out asap ⚡ is publishing some 🔥 content on YouTube about Nostr this is already implemented in the upcoming Habla release and you got the moon URL 😉   Just need a bit more time to release it and make it generally available.Exactly, wouldn't get very close if they have offspring, they are very protective! 💜🐮GM Tanel, have a good one 🫂Replied from amethyst, looks like it shows nip 94 as regular poasts.Replied from amethyst, looks like it shows nip 94 as regular poasts.GM Fishcake 🐮🫂💜🇯🇵Sure! It's the Urbasa Natural Park located in Navarra (Spain) in Europe. Their site is  A magical place.Yes, they belong to farmers in the area but is a natural park where animals are allowed to roam free. You can see donkeys, horses and cows everywhere. They are used to people so are pretty chill. There are also wild boars though, luckily didn't run into one 😅GM nostr, found a group of cows yesterday while walking in the forest. They are chill af, resting and ruminating in the shades, protected from the heat and sun. Happy Monday! 🐮

GM nostr! Not shippostig that much lately since I gotta balance family, work, nostr and other stuff. Cherish and spend time with your loved ones, they are more important than everything else 💜🫂Another thing to consider is that the highlight author could set the OP author pubkey as the zap target so zaps to the highlight will go to the OP. I'll probably do this for my highlights when author is on nostr.I think I'll make it opt in, perhaps with an slider that lets you choose how much each person gets 🤔This is bad, next update will show open in wallet button that should let you choose a Lightning wallet. Will also make QR clickable with same behaviour.1 is doable but hadnt considered it, should be easy to do. 2 is planned, for things like highlights I'll give you the option to zap curator and author.

Also want to be able to fork articles and create derived versions that are linked to the original (translated articles), which will forward zaps to the origina authorl or let you choose an split.Habla is going in this direction, already started working on it.I love it, is the UX I envision for habla. Clean, readable UI and contextualized conversations on highlights. Read, write, bookmark, highlight, subscribe. Awesome work 👏eyes

Buyer can send address and email or public key with payment. Creator can manage orders on admin console. It even has a chat room. It will also be compatible with future split and zap forwarding features.

If the model worked, I will create a nostr client for this.

 Marketplace: 

That it'll get cooler with time, more social (and not social) experiences will be possible on nostr.
NIP94 File header in Amethyst media tab and is only the beginning, lots of "other stuff" will be on nostr in due time. All zapable, addressable and composable. All is an event, they just have different kinds. Can you imagine the possibilities?
Love Haskell since it makes it easy to work with these abstractions although I'm in JS purgatory 😋 I think REQ filters in nostr might be a semigroup, you can add them with an associative operation, ndk library uses this to batch multiple REQ filters into one. There could be a nostr monad, REQ is applicative (adding filters) and monadic (sequence REQ requests after eose).Such a meeting will be held one day before the conference itself.

Bohemian Nostrich meetup 7.6. 2023they are everywhere! Perhaps some concrete examples help build intuition: every time you reduce a collection you are probably using a Monoid The content is a product of who the audience on the platform is. Content fits the market not the other way around.

What we are missing just now is fullscreen video, screen sharing, speaker/mic sharing, automated content generation, integrated money and the gamification of all these things.

Maybe we are just super early and all this things will be bootstrapped out of current things?

But nostr is mostly being used to build Twitter clones, and whilst this has some value none of Twitters replicas will eat it. It’s a sideways move for 90% of users, one chat UX to another chat UX.

The biggest problem for Twitter type platform is that nobody buys stuff there, so it just has a lot less commerce and a much smaller economy.

People buy stuff in an audiovideo UX, people buy stuff in shared spaces, people buy stuff when it’s easy.

The next big social platform might be built on nostr, or it might not, but it will probably be based on fullscreen video. You don’t see 13 year olds swiping text, it feels like school to them.

They crowd to loud bright things that move fast, there’s a big non-verbal bit rate in UX that we are missing.

If nostr or a monolithic nostr client can hook the generation after TikTok then you will have  adoption by default. No way it happens with horizontal migration any time soon, likely to only see it in our lifetimes if it surfs demographics.

There’s now a way to do that. 
There wasn’t before.  Is very early, don't think any client has this featureAmethyst shows highlights and has a media feed 🤩 It also handles naddr mentions perfectly, this is my favorite client atm.

Would you pay a small subscription fee for getting a vanity URL, NIP05 and SEO friendly pages in Habla?

Trying to make a point here, devs do something! 😜Yes although I found it buggy at times and doesn't support mentioning relays. But you can read, comment, boost and zap long form articles from Amethysts, pretty cool!Relays can censor you but you can always rebroadcast your poasts to other relays.Looks great with the preview on Amethyst.

🫂💜 same, let's keep building 👷‍♂️I know, plan is to require a password and use it to encrypt stored private key. Habla will ask for password when it needs to sign to decrypt key and won't keep it in memory. Also give them a NIP05 they can use as username and their profile under habla.news/username. All this while trying to educate them regarding key management.🫂 indeed, i struggle with this too. hard not to be absorbed by it.Yes, we need to do it.

Jackedclients need to agree on a standard replaceable event for last seen notification time imo, this is annoying afThe pleb waiting for you to to say GN back:

 's idea of using private zaps for hiding DM metadata could be generalized as using third-party trusted services to send encrypted DM blobs on your behalf.

These third-parties would be the ones interacting with the relays, not you. If the DMs leaked the public would see just that one of these servers sent a DM to someone, but they wouldn't know who was the original sender.

The receiver would get these messages and decrypt them to be able to see the actual message signed by you inside.

Relays could ban these services if they were being abusive, or charge these services directly (and then they would charge you).

Receivers could also refuse to decrypt and just discard messages from services known for being spammy.Acta, non verbaUna vez publicado el contenido a nostr como nip23 se puede utilizar nblog  de  para generar una web con los artículos de una pubkey prerenderizados.Y si hacemos un repost del contenido del blog a nostr?

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksFound the Safari issue and sent a patch to ndk to fix it, hopefully it will be merged soon.Is a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one?

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

おはよう、fiatjafさんmattnさんのプロフィール写真は面白いです rabbit uses a locally stored relay list if I'm not mistaken. was working on something like this. With nostr profile metadata and  you could create a microsite à la linktree 🤔there is an app by the NIP author, check out  where Pablo demoes it. there is also a huge bounty to add it to Damus  but no takers yet. I'd love NIP-46 in Amethyst too.think i found my zap signature

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksFound the Safari issue and sent a patch to ndk to fix it, hopefully it will be merged soon.Is a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one? Let me know!"Los que me han hecho daño, los políticos que me han hecho daño, ellos serán sustituidos, yo no tengo sustituta, me moriré siendo Lola Flores"

Bonjour Mara, happy Friday! 🫂💜🤙We've made payments as frictionless as liking a post and we still excited about it 😹Looks amazing!🔥Buenos días Nostr! Empezando el día por rumbas 👏 +1000You can try  or use snort.social and upload from therePersian  and Ukrainian  added, thanks to  and boost for visibility 👇

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

thoughts?
interests?I'm blown away by the fast translations. We got 5 languages in a day 🤯 building for the world 🗺️🇷🇺 Хабла говорит по-русски 

Спасибо  💜gotta admit I had a crush on Meryl 🔥

Done 🫡Omw!What languages do you speak? Can add more to the project. I'm paying 10k sats to Habla translators for completing a language.

YesGot big news, will share soon 🥹You can change emoji name anytime. You could import and edit emoji from other lists.🇩🇪 Habla spricht Deutsch 

Danke  💜 I used 30001, not sure if it supports adding and removing emoji, does it  ?Awesome 😍 cc Hungry for memes? Add wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme to your relays list and have all the best memes on  aggregated for you and available at your fingertips in your global feed. 

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.
 being translated to German already 💜 open source is awesome🇪🇸 Habla habla Español 

🇯🇵  Hablaは日本語を話します ありがとうございます! is deployed now in case you want to check, will try to add context to strings in Crowdin.Help the project and get some sats ⚡

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

Pablo can share more info but iirc Zapstr used kind 31337 for audio and podcast tracks. Looking forward to try podstr, love the idea!Got a custom URL on Habla thank you  🔥🔥🔥

For logging in right now you need to use Alby extension on desktop or nostore on mobile to store your nostr key.

Thanks for the recommendations! Vagabond is 👌🫂☕have a good one!The coolest thing about writing long form content over nostr is the ability to combine all kinds of nostr events in a post. NIP 27 mentions enable this, I wonder why other nostr blogging sites are not implementing it. Composability is one of the killer features imo.More clients should allow you to filter feeds by your people lists. Clip from

Yes, thought about this too, should be doable.You can highlight a portion of an article in Habla by selecting the text and clicking the highlighter button that appears on the bottom right of screen.


On highlighter go to Search tab and enter s URL, after the content is loaded the UX is similar to Habla. select text, preview, highlight. Hope it helps.Thanks for your feedback man, join us anytime!Awesome, can't wait to test it 🤗💯Y'all sleeping on highlights, check out highlighter.com and  habla.news Clients such as Amethyst show highlights on your feed and are a great way to discover content on nostr and the web.

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Love your vision and think it'll happen, all the pieces are there.Gm Tony 🫂💜 Hope you have a great one today! Gm Pextar ☕ have a good one!when ur timeline is all uncles 😹

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Love your vision and think it'll happen, all the pieces are there.Gm Tony 🫂💜 Hope you have a great one today! Gm Pextar ☕ have a good one!when ur timeline is all uncles 😹

おはよう、fiatjafさんmattnさんのプロフィール写真は面白いです rabbit uses a locally stored relay list if I'm not mistaken. was working on something like this. With nostr profile metadata and  you could create a microsite à la linktree 🤔there is an app by the NIP author, check out  where Pablo demoes it. there is also a huge bounty to add it to Damus  but no takers yet. I'd love NIP-46 in Amethyst too.think i found my zap signature

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksFound the Safari issue and sent a patch to ndk to fix it, hopefully it will be merged soon.Is a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users.

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

GM nostr! Not shippostig that much lately since I gotta balance family, work, nostr and other stuff. Cherish and spend time with your loved ones, they are more important than everything else 💜🫂Another thing to consider is that the highlight author could set the OP author pubkey as the zap target so zaps to the highlight will go to the OP. I'll probably do this for my highlights when author is on nostr.I think I'll make it opt in, perhaps with an slider that lets you choose how much each person gets 🤔This is bad, next update will show open in wallet button that should let you choose a Lightning wallet. Will also make QR clickable with same behaviour.1 is doable but hadnt considered it, should be easy to do. 2 is planned, for things like highlights I'll give you the option to zap curator and author.

Also want to be able to fork articles and create derived versions that are linked to the original (translated articles), which will forward zaps to the origina authorl or let you choose an split.Habla is going in this direction, already started working on it.I love it, is the UX I envision for habla. Clean, readable UI and contextualized conversations on highlights. Read, write, bookmark, highlight, subscribe. Awesome work 👏これを着ていくか   is good for visibility, hope you find someone!Paging Bullish on nostr markets

That it'll get cooler with time, more social (and not social) experiences will be possible on nostr.
NIP94 File header in Amethyst media tab and is only the beginning, lots of "other stuff" will be on nostr in due time. All zapable, addressable and composable. All is an event, they just have different kinds. Can you imagine the possibilities?
Love Haskell since it makes it easy to work with these abstractions although I'm in JS purgatory 😋 I think REQ filters in nostr might be a semigroup, you can add them with an associative operation, ndk library uses this to batch multiple REQ filters into one. There could be a nostr monad, REQ is applicative (adding filters) and monadic (sequence REQ requests after eose).they are everywhere! Perhaps some concrete examples help build intuition: every time you reduce a collection you are probably using a Monoid The content is a product of who the audience on the platform is. Content fits the market not the other way around.

What we are missing just now is fullscreen video, screen sharing, speaker/mic sharing, automated content generation, integrated money and the gamification of all these things.

Maybe we are just super early and all this things will be bootstrapped out of current things?

But nostr is mostly being used to build Twitter clones, and whilst this has some value none of Twitters replicas will eat it. It’s a sideways move for 90% of users, one chat UX to another chat UX.

The biggest problem for Twitter type platform is that nobody buys stuff there, so it just has a lot less commerce and a much smaller economy.

People buy stuff in an audiovideo UX, people buy stuff in shared spaces, people buy stuff when it’s easy.

The next big social platform might be built on nostr, or it might not, but it will probably be based on fullscreen video. You don’t see 13 year olds swiping text, it feels like school to them.

They crowd to loud bright things that move fast, there’s a big non-verbal bit rate in UX that we are missing.

If nostr or a monolithic nostr client can hook the generation after TikTok then you will have  adoption by default. No way it happens with horizontal migration any time soon, likely to only see it in our lifetimes if it surfs demographics.

There’s now a way to do that. 
There wasn’t before.  Is very early, don't think any client has this featureAmethyst shows highlights and has a media feed 🤩 It also handles naddr mentions perfectly, this is my favorite client atm.

Would you pay a small subscription fee for getting a vanity URL, NIP05 and SEO friendly pages in Habla?  All your content would be accesible from nostr but also indexed by search engines and have nice URLs and previews when sharing for  profile and  postYesNoWrote about this today, there are a few NIP 50 compatible relays already 🤗 would also allow to pay people that are contributing, I'm getting lots of help.Might apply with habla.news We have a clear roadmap for the project and a lot of improvements in the works and coming soon.

Welcome to nostr 🫂 looks beautiful, can't wait to see and learn more about bullet journals 🤩Working on an improved UI in  Hope to release it soon, been giga busy with work lately.Tend to agree, but kind 0 and kind 3 both use JSON strings in content and NIP-51 uses content for the encrypted lists, not sure about other kinds.I hope social clients start displaying highlights on the feed, brilliant idea for content curation and discovery imo.Highlighted a bunch of banger quotes about  by Mircea Popescu, RIP legend. Y'all need to try  ✍️

I'd love to it time permits. It'll be in Habla for sure, both searching in one relay or on all your search compatible relays. Currently is hardcoded but I'm making some changes.

Trying to make a point here, devs do something! 😜Yes although I found it buggy at times and doesn't support mentioning relays. But you can read, comment, boost and zap long form articles from Amethysts, pretty cool!Relays can censor you but you can always rebroadcast your poasts to other relays.Looks great with the preview on Amethyst.

Yeah, some clients don't support these mentions yet unfortunately. Using them to raise awareness. In the meantime you can use  or habla.newsWrote a brief article about Search (NIP 50) compatible relays, check it out!

Habla will ask for password when it needs to sign to decrypt key and won't keep it in memory. Also give them a NIP05 they can use as username and their profile under habla.news/username. All this while trying to educate them regarding key management.🫂 indeed, i struggle with this too. hard not to be absorbed by it.Yes, we need to do it. I'm going to try to do my part with content in Spanish, I'm shilling nostr to my irl friends too and getting their feedback. Trying to make Habla super newbie friendly and add nostr onboarding. Lots to build/write/record.Can't wait for  to launch outer space 👽You first, work nextGrateful for the work Nostr promoters and educators like  and  are doing. Apps are cool but for nostr to succeed we need to make it accesible, improve the UX a lot and most importantly: spread the word 🗣️Yes, habla uses kind 30023 (post) and 30024 (draft) for articles, so events that reuse that kind (bounties for instance) will show up in habla. I think we might want specific kinds for other types of content like podcast, there are several audio apps over nostr like Zapstr.live that could be useful here. Hope it helps!🧪 NIP 30 by Alex Gleason  will allow you to use custom emoji for kind 0 (profile) and kind 1 (note) events 🐸💜🫂 Love your content man, gotta show it ⚡>"I must say, my dear chap, I have no time for pedestrian notes. I exclusively engage in the consumption of long-form content pieces, those that require one's full attention and stimulate the mind in a meaningful way. It's a shame that so many seem content with shallow, bite-sized information. One can only truly appreciate the depth and complexity of a subject by delving into the intricacies of a well-crafted article or essay."

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

 is the cutest nostr clientIs a bug affecting Safari and iOS browser, those are behind in web standards support. I will fix it, in the meantime try another browser and should work.Missing feature, will add! implemented your custom emoji list proposal, still need to make them editable and ability to add lists but I've created some we can use for testing already.Of course!🤗 Imma fix this soon, sorry for the inconvenience Sure, feel free to add more:     Gm nostr, zap some artists today!  cc Kind 30030: categorized custom emoji lists. Proposal by   author of nostter kind 30030 I use words as d tags (these are a timestamp by default). The URL for a post is your nip05 username and d tag, so if you use words for the d identifier you'll get a URL like that for the article.I've sent a PR :)
Zapvertising in action cc Enorme Lola. Aquí con otra mujer que también admiro mucho

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one? Let me know!"Los que me han hecho daño, los políticos que me han hecho daño, ellos serán sustituidos, yo no tengo sustituta, me moriré siendo Lola Flores"

Bonjour Mara, happy Friday! 🫂💜🤙We've made payments as frictionless as liking a post and we still excited about it 😹Looks amazing!🔥Buenos días Nostr! Empezando el día por rumbas 👏 +1000You can try  or use snort.social and upload from therePersian  and Ukrainian  added, thanks to  and boost for visibility 👇

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

thoughts?
interests?I'm blown away by the fast translations. We got 5 languages in a day 🤯 building for the world 🗺️🇷🇺 Хабла говорит по-русски 

Спасибо  💜gotta admit I had a crush on Meryl 🔥

Done 🫡Omw!What languages do you speak? Can add more to the project. I'm paying 10k sats to Habla translators for completing a language.

YesGot big news, will share soon 🥹You can change emoji name anytime. You could import and edit emoji from other lists.🇩🇪 Habla spricht Deutsch 

Danke  💜 I used 30001, not sure if it supports adding and removing emoji, does it  ?Awesome 😍 cc Hungry for memes? Add wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme to your relays list and have all the best memes on  aggregated for you and available at your fingertips in your global feed. 

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.
 being translated to German already 💜 open source is awesome🇪🇸 Habla habla Español 

🇯🇵  Hablaは日本語を話します ありがとうございます! is deployed now in case you want to check, will try to add context to strings in Crowdin.Help the project and get some sats ⚡

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

Pablo can share more info but iirc Zapstr used kind 31337 for audio and podcast tracks. Looking forward to try podstr, love the idea!Got a custom URL on Habla thank you  🔥🔥🔥

NIP 27 mentions enable this, I wonder why other nostr blogging sites are not implementing it.

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

おはよう、fiatjafさんmattnさんのプロフィール写真は面白いです rabbit uses a locally stored relay list if I'm not mistaken. was working on something like this. With nostr profile metadata and  you could create a microsite à la linktree 🤔there is an app by the NIP author, check out  where Pablo demoes it. there is also a huge bounty to add it to Damus  but no takers yet. I'd love NIP-46 in Amethyst too.think i found my zap signature

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksFound the Safari issue and sent a patch to ndk to fix it, hopefully it will be merged soon.Is a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one? Let me know!"Los que me han hecho daño, los políticos que me han hecho daño, ellos serán sustituidos, yo no tengo sustituta, me moriré siendo Lola Flores"

Bonjour Mara, happy Friday! 🫂💜🤙We've made payments as frictionless as liking a post and we still excited about it 😹Looks amazing!🔥Buenos días Nostr!

YesGot big news, will share soon 🥹You can change emoji name anytime. You could import and edit emoji from other lists.🇩🇪 Habla spricht Deutsch 

Danke  💜 I used 30001, not sure if it supports adding and removing emoji, does it  ?Awesome 😍 cc Hungry for memes? Add wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme to your relays list and have all the best memes on  aggregated for you and available at your fingertips in your global feed. 

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

Pablo can share more info but iirc Zapstr used kind 31337 for audio and podcast tracks. Looking forward to try podstr, love the idea!Got a custom URL on Habla thank you  🔥🔥🔥

These two nips is all we need to have transparent Inter-kind Inter operation and compete with super apps’ UX without the centralizationHay relays con políticas relacionadas con el pow pero no veo que se utilice mucho fuera de eso.who prefers likes to sats? sats are internet points you can use to pay for stuffAgree, fiatjaf and others are writing a NIP for fallbacks. There is also some discussion around user defined kind handlers, clients could use this to open an unsupported event kind in a user defined app.I'm working on making it easier so sorry for the non obvious UX. For logging in right now you need to use Alby extension on desktop or nostore on mobile to store your nostr key. Once you have that, click Login and select "Nostr extension" and you should be able to write, repost and so on.

This will get easier in the future and more options will be available.No problem, check out  for the specPoW-21 is shown under username. iiuc this means that note id has 21 leading bits set to 0.Issuer is what makes a badge valuable 💯 we've seen a few examples of the things you mentioned:

Thanks for the recommendations! Vagabond is 👌🫂☕have a good one!The coolest thing about writing long form content over nostr is the ability to combine all kinds of nostr events in a post. NIP 27 mentions enable this, I wonder why other nostr blogging sites are not implementing it. Composability is one of the killer features imo.More clients should allow you to filter feeds by your people lists. Clip from 

iirc there was a Chess NIP that could be used to implement Go or other games over nostr. Hope someone builds it.Gotta check out these! Weird and creepy afThis is one of my favorites. I got into Go after watching but haven't played in ages, amazing game!おはようNさん💜Gm sir, have a good one ☕💜🤗GM nostr, what's your favorite ? Pic related, Gatsu from Berserk.

Yes, thought about this too, should be doable.You can highlight a portion of an article in Habla by selecting the text and clicking the highlighter button that appears on the bottom right of screen.


On highlighter go to Search tab and enter s URL, after the content is loaded the UX is similar to Habla. select text, preview, highlight. Hope it helps.Thanks for your feedback man, join us anytime!Awesome, can't wait to test it 🤗💯Y'all sleeping on highlights, check out highlighter.com and  habla.news Clients such as Amethyst show highlights on your feed and are a great way to discover content on nostr and the web.

Nearly ready...  is now rendering images, hashtags, links, and user mentions in notes.

Looks 🔥 

Everything can be listed, even lists 😜Nice working space! loving the feed for lists of people, "Follow all" is nice to have. Also support for the emoji tag would be cool 🤗There is a lot of interest in "following lists" too, wdyt?you got me 😜When you start the day sending patches to multiple nostr open source projects

Regarding dark mode it now should respect your system settings.

You pin lists that you want to see in your feeds, yours or from others.Is there a client other than Amethyst that allows to browse feed by NIP51 people list?Made a list with everyone involved in Habla.

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one? Let me know!"Los que me han hecho daño, los políticos que me han hecho daño, ellos serán sustituidos, yo no tengo sustituta, me moriré siendo Lola Flores"

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

Done 🫡Omw!What languages do you speak? Can add more to the project. I'm paying 10k sats to Habla translators for completing a language.

YesGot big news, will share soon 🥹You can change emoji name anytime. You could import and edit emoji from other lists.🇩🇪 Habla spricht Deutsch 

Danke  💜 I used 30001, not sure if it supports adding and removing emoji, does it  ?Awesome 😍 cc Hungry for memes? Add wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme to your relays list and have all the best memes on  aggregated for you and available at your fingertips in your global feed. 

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.
 being translated to German already 💜 open source is awesome🇪🇸 Habla habla Español 

🇯🇵  Hablaは日本語を話します ありがとうございます! is deployed now in case you want to check, will try to add context to strings in Crowdin.Help the project and get some sats ⚡

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

Pablo can share more info but iirc Zapstr used kind 31337 for audio and podcast tracks. Looking forward to try podstr, love the idea!Got a custom URL on Habla thank you  🔥🔥🔥

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Love your vision and think it'll happen, all the pieces are there.Gm Tony 🫂💜 Hope you have a great one today! Gm Pextar ☕ have a good one!when ur timeline is all uncles 😹

おはよう、fiatjafさんmattnさんのプロフィール写真は面白いです rabbit uses a locally stored relay list if I'm not mistaken. was working on something like this. With nostr profile metadata and  you could create a microsite à la linktree 🤔there is an app by the NIP author, check out  where Pablo demoes it. there is also a huge bounty to add it to Damus  but no takers yet. I'd love NIP-46 in Amethyst too.think i found my zap signature

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksFound the Safari issue and sent a patch to ndk to fix it, hopefully it will be merged soon.Is a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre

There is also some discussion around user defined kind handlers, clients could use this to open an unsupported event kind in a user defined app.I'm working on making it easier so sorry for the non obvious UX. For logging in right now you need to use Alby extension on desktop or nostore on mobile to store your nostr key. Once you have that, click Login and select "Nostr extension" and you should be able to write, repost and so on.

This will get easier in the future and more options will be available.No problem, check out  for the specPoW-21 is shown under username. iiuc this means that note id has 21 leading bits set to 0.Issuer is what makes a badge valuable 💯 we've seen a few examples of the things you mentioned:

NIP 27 mentions enable this, I wonder why other nostr blogging sites are not implementing it.

Yes, thought about this too, should be doable.You can highlight a portion of an article in Habla by selecting the text and clicking the highlighter button that appears on the bottom right of screen.


On highlighter go to Search tab and enter s URL, after the content is loaded the UX is similar to Habla. select text, preview, highlight. Hope it helps.Thanks for your feedback man, join us anytime!Awesome, can't wait to test it 🤗💯Y'all sleeping on highlights, check out highlighter.com and  habla.news Clients such as Amethyst show highlights on your feed and are a great way to discover content on nostr and the web.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one?

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

Danke  💜 I used 30001, not sure if it supports adding and removing emoji, does it  ?Awesome 😍 cc Hungry for memes? Add wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme to your relays list and have all the best memes on  aggregated for you and available at your fingertips in your global feed. 

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

There is also some discussion around user defined kind handlers, clients could use this to open an unsupported event kind in a user defined app.I'm working on making it easier so sorry for the non obvious UX. For logging in right now you need to use Alby extension on desktop or nostore on mobile to store your nostr key.

That it'll get cooler with time, more social (and not social) experiences will be possible on nostr.
NIP94 File header in Amethyst media tab and is only the beginning, lots of "other stuff" will be on nostr in due time. All zapable, addressable and composable. All is an event, they just have different kinds. Can you imagine the possibilities?
Love Haskell since it makes it easy to work with these abstractions although I'm in JS purgatory 😋 I think REQ filters in nostr might be a semigroup, you can add them with an associative operation, ndk library uses this to batch multiple REQ filters into one. There could be a nostr monad, REQ is applicative (adding filters) and monadic (sequence REQ requests after eose).Such a meeting will be held one day before the conference itself.

Bohemian Nostrich meetup 7.6. 2023they are everywhere! Perhaps some concrete examples help build intuition: every time you reduce a collection you are probably using a Monoid The content is a product of who the audience on the platform is. Content fits the market not the other way around.

What we are missing just now is fullscreen video, screen sharing, speaker/mic sharing, automated content generation, integrated money and the gamification of all these things.

Maybe we are just super early and all this things will be bootstrapped out of current things?

But nostr is mostly being used to build Twitter clones, and whilst this has some value none of Twitters replicas will eat it. It’s a sideways move for 90% of users, one chat UX to another chat UX.

The biggest problem for Twitter type platform is that nobody buys stuff there, so it just has a lot less commerce and a much smaller economy.

People buy stuff in an audiovideo UX, people buy stuff in shared spaces, people buy stuff when it’s easy.

The next big social platform might be built on nostr, or it might not, but it will probably be based on fullscreen video. You don’t see 13 year olds swiping text, it feels like school to them.

They crowd to loud bright things that move fast, there’s a big non-verbal bit rate in UX that we are missing.

If nostr or a monolithic nostr client can hook the generation after TikTok then you will have  adoption by default. No way it happens with horizontal migration any time soon, likely to only see it in our lifetimes if it surfs demographics.

There’s now a way to do that. 
There wasn’t before.  Is very early, don't think any client has this featureAmethyst shows highlights and has a media feed 🤩 It also handles naddr mentions perfectly, this is my favorite client atm.

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one?

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

NIP 27 mentions enable this, I wonder why other nostr blogging sites are not implementing it. Composability is one of the killer features imo.More clients should allow you to filter feeds by your people lists. Clip from

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Love your vision and think it'll happen, all the pieces are there.Gm Tony 🫂💜 Hope you have a great one today! Gm Pextar ☕ have a good one!when ur timeline is all uncles 😹

GM nostr! Not shippostig that much lately since I gotta balance family, work, nostr and other stuff. Cherish and spend time with your loved ones, they are more important than everything else 💜🫂Another thing to consider is that the highlight author could set the OP author pubkey as the zap target so zaps to the highlight will go to the OP. I'll probably do this for my highlights when author is on nostr.I think I'll make it opt in, perhaps with an slider that lets you choose how much each person gets 🤔This is bad, next update will show open in wallet button that should let you choose a Lightning wallet. Will also make QR clickable with same behaviour.1 is doable but hadnt considered it, should be easy to do. 2 is planned, for things like highlights I'll give you the option to zap curator and author.

Also want to be able to fork articles and create derived versions that are linked to the original (translated articles), which will forward zaps to the origina authorl or let you choose an split.Habla is going in this direction, already started working on it.I love it, is the UX I envision for habla. Clean, readable UI and contextualized conversations on highlights. Read, write, bookmark, highlight, subscribe. Awesome work 👏eyes

これを着ていくか   is good for visibility, hope you find someone!Paging 
NIP94 File header in Amethyst media tab and is only the beginning, lots of "other stuff" will be on nostr in due time. All zapable, addressable and composable. All is an event, they just have different kinds. Can you imagine the possibilities?
Love Haskell since it makes it easy to work with these abstractions although I'm in JS purgatory 😋 I think REQ filters in nostr might be a semigroup, you can add them with an associative operation, ndk library uses this to batch multiple REQ filters into one. There could be a nostr monad, REQ is applicative (adding filters) and monadic (sequence REQ requests after eose).Such a meeting will be held one day before the conference itself.

Hosted by:

 and  and 

Bohemian Nostrich meetup 7.6. 2023they are everywhere! Perhaps some concrete examples help build intuition: every time you reduce a collection you are probably using a Monoid The content is a product of who the audience on the platform is. Content fits the market not the other way around.

What we are missing just now is fullscreen video, screen sharing, speaker/mic sharing, automated content generation, integrated money and the gamification of all these things.

Maybe we are just super early and all this things will be bootstrapped out of current things?

But nostr is mostly being used to build Twitter clones, and whilst this has some value none of Twitters replicas will eat it. It’s a sideways move for 90% of users, one chat UX to another chat UX.

The biggest problem for Twitter type platform is that nobody buys stuff there, so it just has a lot less commerce and a much smaller economy.

People buy stuff in an audiovideo UX, people buy stuff in shared spaces, people buy stuff when it’s easy.

The next big social platform might be built on nostr, or it might not, but it will probably be based on fullscreen video. You don’t see 13 year olds swiping text, it feels like school to them.

They crowd to loud bright things that move fast, there’s a big non-verbal bit rate in UX that we are missing.

If nostr or a monolithic nostr client can hook the generation after TikTok then you will have  adoption by default. No way it happens with horizontal migration any time soon, likely to only see it in our lifetimes if it surfs demographics.

There’s now a way to do that. 
There wasn’t before.  Is very early, don't think any client has this featureAmethyst shows highlights and has a media feed 🤩 It also handles naddr mentions perfectly, this is my favorite client atm.

Would you pay a small subscription fee for getting a vanity URL, NIP05 and SEO friendly pages in Habla?  All your content would be accesible from nostr but also indexed by search engines and have nice URLs and previews when sharing for  profile and  postYesNoWrote about this today, there are a few NIP 50 compatible relays already 🤗 would also allow to pay people that are contributing, I'm getting lots of help.Might apply with habla.news We have a clear roadmap for the project and a lot of improvements in the works and coming soon.

I'd love to it time permits. It'll be in Habla for sure, both searching in one relay or on all your search compatible relays. Currently is hardcoded but I'm making some changes.

Trying to make a point here, devs do something! 😜Yes although I found it buggy at times and doesn't support mentioning relays. But you can read, comment, boost and zap long form articles from Amethysts, pretty cool!Relays can censor you but you can always rebroadcast your poasts to other relays.Looks great with the preview on Amethyst.

🫂💜 same, let's keep building 👷‍♂️I know, plan is to require a password and use it to encrypt stored private key. Habla will ask for password when it needs to sign to decrypt key and won't keep it in memory. Also give them a NIP05 they can use as username and their profile under habla.news/username. All this while trying to educate them regarding key management.🫂 indeed, i struggle with this too. hard not to be absorbed by it.Yes, we need to do it. I'm going to try to do my part with content in Spanish, I'm shilling nostr to my irl friends too and getting their feedback. Trying to make Habla super newbie friendly and add nostr onboarding. Lots to build/write/record.Can't wait for  to launch outer space 👽You first, work nextGrateful for the work Nostr promoters and educators like  and  are doing. Apps are cool but for nostr to succeed we need to make it accesible, improve the UX a lot and most importantly: spread the word 🗣️Yes, habla uses kind 30023 (post) and 30024 (draft) for articles, so events that reuse that kind (bounties for instance) will show up in habla. I think we might want specific kinds for other types of content like podcast, there are several audio apps over nostr like Zapstr.live that could be useful here. Hope it helps!🧪 NIP 30 by Alex Gleason  will allow you to use custom emoji for kind 0 (profile) and kind 1 (note) events 🐸How do you sign-in to a Nostr website?

Nostr websites can be confusing if you haven’t used a signing extension like Alby before so I made a little demo video to try to clarify how this works. In it I featured Alby, Highlighter, Primal, Wavman, and Habla.

Jackedclients need to agree on a standard replaceable event for last seen notification time imo, this is annoying afThe pleb waiting for you to to say GN back:

 's idea of using private zaps for hiding DM metadata could be generalized as using third-party trusted services to send encrypted DM blobs on your behalf.

These third-parties would be the ones interacting with the relays, not you. If the DMs leaked the public would see just that one of these servers sent a DM to someone, but they wouldn't know who was the original sender.

The receiver would get these messages and decrypt them to be able to see the actual message signed by you inside.

Relays could ban these services if they were being abusive, or charge these services directly (and then they would charge you).

Receivers could also refuse to decrypt and just discard messages from services known for being spammy.Acta, non verbaUna vez publicado el contenido a nostr como nip23 se puede utilizar nblog  de  para generar una web con los artículos de una pubkey prerenderizados.Y si hacemos un repost del contenido del blog a nostr?

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Love your vision and think it'll happen, all the pieces are there.Gm Tony 🫂💜 Hope you have a great one today! Gm Pextar ☕ have a good one!when ur timeline is all uncles 😹

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksFound the Safari issue and sent a patch to ndk to fix it, hopefully it will be merged soon.Is a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one?

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠I’d love a node based interface to build “notes trees”.

Think of the Notes Tree as an article, but it is made of a multitude of notes, highlights and links by the author AND other plebs. You start reading at the trunk with the intention of reaching the end, the tip of the tree. But, you can sidetrack your audience in branches (additional information, anecdotes, sponsored content, referenced conversations, media,…). 

This would make the reading of an article a tad more interactive. If I am not interested by the content of a branch, I can read its summary note and move on, or if I want to I can explore the branch. 

When building the tree I would see the existing connection between notes (quote notes, replies) and decide what notes and what connections I want to include in the note tree. I could load notes and other “assets” in a “notes library” and easily drag, drop, connect and rearrange.  I could write private notes that would be published only once the tree is published. 

The UX of exploring a published tree would be client specific (same with the building of it) 

VFX compositing meets blog writing. Lateral thinking or waste of time?Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Love your vision and think it'll happen, all the pieces are there.Gm Tony 🫂💜 Hope you have a great one today! Gm Pextar ☕ have a good one!when ur timeline is all uncles 😹

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksIs a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one? Let me know!"Los que me han hecho daño, los políticos que me han hecho daño, ellos serán sustituidos, yo no tengo sustituta, me moriré siendo Lola Flores"

Bonjour Mara, happy Friday! 🫂💜🤙We've made payments as frictionless as liking a post and we still excited about it 😹Looks amazing!🔥Buenos días Nostr! Empezando el día por rumbas 👏 +1000You can try  or use snort.social and upload from therePersian  and Ukrainian  added, thanks to  and boost for visibility 👇

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

thoughts?
interests?I'm blown away by the fast translations. We got 5 languages in a day 🤯 building for the world 🗺️🇷🇺 Хабла говорит по-русски 

Спасибо  💜gotta admit I had a crush on Meryl 🔥

Done 🫡Omw!What languages do you speak? Can add more to the project. I'm paying 10k sats to Habla translators for completing a language.

YesGot big news, will share soon 🥹You can change emoji name anytime. You could import and edit emoji from other lists.🇩🇪 Habla spricht Deutsch 

Danke  💜 I used 30001, not sure if it supports adding and removing emoji, does it  ?Awesome 😍 cc Hungry for memes? Add wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme to your relays list and have all the best memes on  aggregated for you and available at your fingertips in your global feed. 

Wanna know how this works, find out a few tips and tricks on how to enhance your Nostr experience or even start running your own feed? Check out my “Feed Runner” guide:  

Like my 🐸 Meme Hub relay?  the hell out of my profile 😈

Welcome Curated Feeds: 

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio. 

And you know what?

You can create your own curated feed, and let others subscribe to it!

It's built around labels, NIP-32. You add some labels to some notes, and our custom relay will then serve the notes you've curated.

Here a deeper overview by  

There are many approaches to curation, algorithms and filtering. Hopefully, this new tool could help Nostr become more engaging, welcoming, diverse and safe.

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

Pablo can share more info but iirc Zapstr used kind 31337 for audio and podcast tracks. Looking forward to try podstr, love the idea!Got a custom URL on Habla thank you  🔥🔥🔥

There is also some discussion around user defined kind handlers, clients could use this to open an unsupported event kind in a user defined app.I'm working on making it easier so sorry for the non obvious UX. For logging in right now you need to use Alby extension on desktop or nostore on mobile to store your nostr key.

NIP 27 mentions enable this, I wonder why other nostr blogging sites are not implementing it. Composability is one of the killer features imo.More clients should allow you to filter feeds by your people lists. Clip from

Yes, thought about this too, should be doable.You can highlight a portion of an article in Habla by selecting the text and clicking the highlighter button that appears on the bottom right of screen.

 being translated to German already 💜 open source is awesome🇪🇸 Habla habla Español 

🇯🇵  Hablaは日本語を話します ありがとうございます! is deployed now in case you want to check, will try to add context to strings in Crowdin.Help the project and get some sats ⚡

 💦Can't wait for custom emoji lists to be implemented to yoink all your emoji 😜There is a zap gate spec being discussed  Habla doesn't host any content but once spec is finalized it'll allow you to unlock zap gated content. iiuc this will enable paywalls for text or images, i will implement when merged. I've noticed some podcasts on Zapstr are zap gated so a standard way to do this is needed that works across clients.Gm 💜🐴Vitor is formalizing the spec for zap splits  Want to implement this in Habla as soon as is merged. When posting, highlighting or reposting you'll be able to configure how the zaps to the event will be distributed between participants. When zapping you'll see how the value is split.My opinion is that fits both as a bookmark list with an "emoji" or "custom-emoji" d tag and as a replaceable event with custom kind and a list of emoji tags. What you think is best? In any case I think it'd be good to add it to the NIP so all clients do the same.Gm sir, woke up full of energy today ⚡ let's get it!GM nostr!

Pablo can share more info but iirc Zapstr used kind 31337 for audio and podcast tracks. Looking forward to try podstr, love the idea!Got a custom URL on Habla thank you  🔥🔥🔥

Zapping with NWC

 awayuki emoji are the cutest Waiting for the 69th comment 🫠Was thinking the other day that nostr lists can be used to represent these tree like documents. Leaves of this tree are event tags (p, e, a, r, t and more). I think Pablo is experimenting with this idea with Highlighter Atlas, can't wait to see where is going.

I foresee us being able to compose rich interlinked documents using nostr lists and events, and these documents can be shared if multiple people have access to the private key.

Love your vision and think it'll happen, all the pieces are there.Gm Tony 🫂💜 Hope you have a great one today! Gm Pextar ☕ have a good one!when ur timeline is all uncles 😹

おはよう、fiatjafさんmattnさんのプロフィール写真は面白いです rabbit uses a locally stored relay list if I'm not mistaken. was working on something like this. With nostr profile metadata and  you could create a microsite à la linktree 🤔there is an app by the NIP author, check out  where Pablo demoes it. there is also a huge bounty to add it to Damus  but no takers yet. I'd love NIP-46 in Amethyst too.think i found my zap signature

There is a language filter proof of concept PR, been testing it and is pretty accurate. Needs some work to be able to release it tho🫡 big fan of what G is doing with nostrovia and nostrocket, did my part ⚡Nostrovia deserves your sats

I'm hoping to remove the requirement to use an extension and allow you to log in with NIP 46. Keep the feedback coming 💜🫂iOS*. wen edit button?👏 Open source is awesome. There was a nasty bug affecting Habla users in iO, certain versions of Safari  and other mobile browsers. Submitted a patch to ndk and the 🐐s  and  swiftly merged and released a new version. The issue should be fixed now and  should render correctly in those browsers.

I'd appreciate if you can test it and report issues if you find them, was able to confirm the issue was fixed in desktop Safari but don't have iOS. cc  💜🙏thanksFound the Safari issue and sent a patch to ndk to fix it, hopefully it will be merged soon.Is a bug 🐛 will take a look, thanks for the heads up!Rabbit is amazing, it'll now be able to store your custom emoji on nostr for client interoperability 🤗 I'm experimenting with  custom emoji list proposal in  Idea is to be able to create and reuse custom emoji packs for nostr notes.

Anyone can create an emoji pack. These are editable and of course can be zapped. I'm looking forward to artists like  creating emoji packs we can zap and reuse.

If you like an emoji pack just add it to your personal list. Your personal emoji list contains a list of emojis and packs you want to use, clients will be able to suggest these custom emoji when typing notes. Cuando escucho la vieja voz de mi sangre

Hoy es un día triste para España, hoy se celebran las elecciones autonómicas, hoy se celebra la fiesta de la democracia, hoy se vota la dictadura del 51% sobre el 49%, hoy se vota a tu ladrón favorito, hoy se vota por perpetuar un sistema que expolia más del 50% de la riqueza de sus ciudadanos, hoy es un día triste.



Como dice George Carlin, los políticos no caen del cielo, los políticos surgen de la sociedad, ¿Qué esperas que salga de una sociedad que esta podrida? Una sociedad que no tiene pensamiento crítico, una sociedad cuya principal fuente de información son los medios de desinformación, una sociedad que permitió que se ejecutaran medidas draconianas durante la falsa pandemia contra su propia población propias de una dictadura distópica.



No existen las democracias occidentales, si no me crees, lee los clásicos griegos y entenderás que es una democracia y la responsabilidad que conlleva para el ciudadano. En los países occidentales solo existe un sistema y partidos que sirven al sistema, tu voto solo sirve para perpetuar sistema, el robo y el expolio.



Pero yo te ofrezco una solución, utiliza activos duros para comerciar y ahorrar, intenta crear una economía paralela al estado y estafa al estado siempre que puedas y sobre todo no votes, no seas participe de la mentira, del robo y del sistema.

Gracias por compartir Fran, le echo un vistazo 👀yep i'm aware, will try to fix it this weekend. thanks for the heads up!Nice, would be cool to have these stored in nostr for client interop. I think there was a proposal by nostter author, can't wait for it to be implemented. how are these stored? love it!  yes, the cutest nostr client 🐰custom emoji?!

No, pero podría añadir un campo opcional para etiquetar los posts con el idioma. Creo recordar que alguien propuso el tag l para que se indexara y poder filtrar.Looks like a forgot to publish the updated Habla source code 🤦‍♂️ Anyway, is here: 

Some highlights:
- Ported relay connection management to ndk 
- Added a client-side IndexedDB cache for optimizing relay usage. ndk made this extremely easy! 🤯 
- Static rendering for Habla nip05 users. You can get an Habla nostr address and prerendered vanity URL with your profile and content; these URLs have a nice preview and are indexable by search engines:  Want one?

can nostr plebs record?  

I'm thinking it might be useful to do nostr nests where we help new developers with their nostr data modeling;

I see so much legacy thinking when modeling data structures for nostr ("just dump a JSON in the content field!")

it might be useful to hash these out in public and have the reasoning as publishable episodes so other people can benefit from the recordings.

Many people believe Nostr needs some new feeds.

Here is one: wss://feeds.nostr.band/popular - all notes with 10+ interactions.

Or another: wss://feeds.nostr.band/meme - some memes, as you might expect (curated by  ).

Add a feed URL to your relay list. Then, if your app allows that (Damus), you can go to Global, switch off other relays, and enjoy the nice filtered feed.

There are also feeds with pictures, video or audio.

Will also make QR clickable with same behaviour.1 is doable but hadnt considered it, should be easy to do. 2 is planned, for things like highlights I'll give you the option to zap curator and author.

Also want to be able to fork articles and create derived versions that are linked to the original (translated articles), which will forward zaps to the origina authorl or let you choose an split.Habla is going in this direction, already started working on it.I love it, is the UX I envision for habla. Clean, readable UI and contextualized conversations on highlights. Read, write, bookmark, highlight, subscribe. Awesome work 👏eyes

That it'll get cooler with time, more social (and not social) experiences will be possible on nostr.
NIP94 File header in Amethyst media tab and is only the beginning, lots of "other stuff" will be on nostr in due time. All zapable, addressable and composable. All is an event, they just have different kinds. Can you imagine the possibilities?
Love Haskell since it makes it easy to work with these abstractions although I'm in JS purgatory 😋 I think REQ filters in nostr might be a semigroup, you can add them with an associative operation, ndk library uses this to batch multiple REQ filters into one. There could be a nostr monad, REQ is applicative (adding filters) and monadic (sequence REQ requests after eose).Such a meeting will be held one day before the conference itself.

Bohemian Nostrich meetup 7.6. 2023Wrote about this today, there are a few NIP 50 compatible relays already 🤗 would also allow to pay people that are contributing, I'm getting lots of help.Might apply with habla.news We have a clear roadmap for the project and a lot of improvements in the works and coming soon. Can get it done a lot faster with funding 🤔

Welcome to nostr 🫂 looks beautiful, can't wait to see and learn more about bullet journals 🤩Announcement:

  Working on an improved UI in  Hope to release it soon, been giga busy with work lately.Tend to agree, but kind 0 and kind 3 both use JSON strings in content and NIP-51 uses content for the encrypted lists, not sure about other kinds.Great example of a value add Nostr service. Building more value over time helps stay competitive and potential offer additional premium services that can help cover costs and make a sustainable growing business.   I hope social clients start displaying highlights on the feed, brilliant idea for content curation and discovery imo.Highlighted a bunch of banger quotes about  by Mircea Popescu, RIP legend. Y'all need to try  ✍️

I'd love to it time permits. It'll be in Habla for sure, both searching in one relay or on all your search compatible relays. Currently is hardcoded but I'm making some changes.

Trying to make a point here, devs do something! 😜Yes although I found it buggy at times and doesn't support mentioning relays. But you can read, comment, boost and zap long form articles from Amethysts, pretty cool!Relays can censor you but you can always rebroadcast your poasts to other relays.Looks great with the preview on Amethyst.

Yeah, some clients don't support these mentions yet unfortunately. Using them to raise awareness. In the meantime you can use  or habla.newsWrote a brief article about Search (NIP 50) compatible relays, check it out!

🐶🐾😂🐸🐸🐸
   censor deez 🥜

Experimenting with using labels to show relay capabilities. Blog, Markets, Chat, Auth, Search are more human friendly representations of NIPs that the relay supports. Sorry for the random colors, work in progress lol

🦓Will there be a nostr meetup for the conference? That would be cool👀 interested in this, let me know if I can help!soon™️ we are working on a FAQ that should cover most of the questions people have, also reworking and simplifying the site a bit.Nostr is べたべたNot yet, works in the old one. Need to add it here too. Wip.Btw check out  it allows to pase an naddr and add/remove relays.reliable is the d tag, been using human readable strings. How this will work is that I'll offer NIP05 addresses in Habla, then your username is an alias for an nprofile. Can use the d tag as unique identifier for posts under your username. Will also make it compatible with external nostr address, this already works  is just not prerendered.How do these URLs look? 🤔 mfw looking at my gas bill

🫂💜 same, let's keep building 👷‍♂️I know, plan is to require a password and use it to encrypt stored private key. Habla will ask for password when it needs to sign to decrypt key and won't keep it in memory. Also give them a NIP05 they can use as username and their profile under habla.news/username. All this while trying to educate them regarding key management.🫂 indeed, i struggle with this too. hard not to be absorbed by it.Yes, we need to do it. I'm going to try to do my part with content in Spanish, I'm shilling nostr to my irl friends too and getting their feedback. Trying to make Habla super newbie friendly and add nostr onboarding. Lots to build/write/record.Can't wait for  to launch outer space 👽You first, work nextGrateful for the work Nostr promoters and educators like  and  are doing. Apps are cool but for nostr to succeed we need to make it accesible, improve the UX a lot and most importantly: spread the word 🗣️Yes, habla uses kind 30023 (post) and 30024 (draft) for articles, so events that reuse that kind (bounties for instance) will show up in habla. I think we might want specific kinds for other types of content like podcast, there are several audio apps over nostr like Zapstr.live that could be useful here. Hope it helps!🧪 NIP 30 by Alex Gleason  will allow you to use custom emoji for kind 0 (profile) and kind 1 (note) events 🐸How do you sign-in to a Nostr website?

Nostr websites can be confusing if you haven’t used a signing extension like Alby before so I made a little demo video to try to clarify how this works. In it I featured Alby, Highlighter, Primal, Wavman, and Habla.

I exclusively engage in the consumption of long-form content pieces, those that require one's full attention and stimulate the mind in a meaningful way. It's a shame that so many seem content with shallow, bite-sized information. One can only truly appreciate the depth and complexity of a subject by delving into the intricacies of a well-crafted article or essay."

Jackedclients need to agree on a standard replaceable event for last seen notification time imo, this is annoying afThe pleb waiting for you to to say GN back:

 's idea of using private zaps for hiding DM metadata could be generalized as using third-party trusted services to send encrypted DM blobs on your behalf.

These third-parties would be the ones interacting with the relays, not you. If the DMs leaked the public would see just that one of these servers sent a DM to someone, but they wouldn't know who was the original sender.

The receiver would get these messages and decrypt them to be able to see the actual message signed by you inside.

Relays could ban these services if they were being abusive, or charge these services directly (and then they would charge you).

Receivers could also refuse to decrypt and just discard messages from services known for being spammy.Acta, non verbaUna vez publicado el contenido a nostr como nip23 se puede utilizar nblog  de  para generar una web con los artículos de una pubkey prerenderizados.
